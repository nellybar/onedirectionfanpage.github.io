            <h3>Niall Horan</h3>
            <img src="Images/Niall.png" alt="Niall">
            <p>Niall Horan was born on September 13, 1993, in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland. At the age of
                16, he auditioned for the television show The X Factor and was accepted into the competition.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Although he did not make the final rounds as a solo vocalist, he joined forces with Harry Styles,
                    Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson to form the highly successful boy band One Direction.
                    Horan later launched a solo career, topping the charts in 2017 with his debut album, Flicker.
                    <br><br>In 2010, when he was 16 years old, Horan auditioned for the television talent competition
                    The X Factor. He moved through several rounds of preliminary auditions, culminating in a
                    performance for the program's judges, including Simon Cowell and guest judge Katy Perry, in
                    Dublin. He sang a version of Ne-Yo's "So Sick" and was accepted into the official competition.
                    Although he was eliminated as a solo contestant after the semifinals, the judges combined Horan
                    with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson to form the boy band One
                    Direction.<br><br>Although One Direction did not win the final round of The X Factor, the band
                    immediately received a contract with Cowell's label Syco and recorded its first album, Up All
                    Night, which became a best seller in the United Kingdom in 2011 and in the United States in
                    2012.<br><br>The only One Direction member born outside England, Horan enjoyed tremendous success
                    with his
                    bandmates, their albums Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) all
                    debuting atop the Billboard 200.<br><br>Horan dropped his debut solo single, "This Town," in
                    September 2016. He followed with two more singles, "Slow Hands" and "Too Much to Ask," before
                    finally delivering the chart-topping album Flicker in October 2017.<br>

            <img src="Images/Zayn.png" alt="Zayn">
            <p>Malik was born Zain Javadd Malik on January 12, 1993, in Bradford, a town located in the county of
                West Yorkshire in Northern England. Zayn Malik had an early love for singing and performing, and at
                the age of 17, he appeared on the competition series The X Factor.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Malik was eliminated before the final round of the competition, but judges Nicole Scherzinger and
                    Simon
                    Cowell grouped him with fellow competitors Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson
                    to
                    form a new act for the remainder of the show.<br><br>One Direction topped the pop music charts with
                    their first single, "What Makes You Beautiful," when it was released in September 2011 in the United
                    Kingdom. Their debut album, Up All Night, was a best seller in both the United Kingdom and the
                    United
                    States in 2012. Malik toured extensively with One Direction, meeting the band's young female fans
                    around
                    the world.<br><br>In March 2015, Malik surprised fans by dropping out of the group's world tour. A
                    spokesperson for the band tweeted that "Zayn has been signed off with stress and is flying back to
                    the
                    UK to recuperate." On March 25, Malik announced that he was leaving One Direction for good. In a
                    statement on Facebook, he wrote: "After five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to
                    leave
                    the band. I'd like to apologize to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels
                    right
                    in my heart."<br><br>Not long after leaving One Direction, Malik launched his solo music career with
                    a
                    demo version of "I Don't Mind," which was leaked online by producer Naughty Boy. Official singles
                    soon
                    followed, including "Pillowtalk" and "It's You." Both of these tracks were featured on his first
                    album,
                    Mind of Mine, which debuted at No. 1 in both the U.K. and the U.S. in spring 2016. Malik also
                    enjoyed
                    commercial success later that year for his collaboration with Taylor Swift on "I Don't Wanna Live
                    Forever," from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack.</p>

            <img src="Images/Liam.png" alt="Liam">
            <p>Liam was born in Wolverhampton, West Midland, England, UK. He unexpectedly died at age 31 after
                falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October 16th 2024. He was a
                member of One Direction from
                its inception on the TV competition show The X Factor in 2010</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>After One Direction's hiatus, Payne signed a recording deal with Republic Records in North
                    America. In May 2017, Payne released "Strip That Down" as the lead single from his debut album.
                    It peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100, being
                    certified platinum in both countries. His debut album, LP1, was released in December 2019. He has
                    sold over 18 million singles in under three years since One Direction's hiatus, and over 3.9 billion
                    career streams in that span.<br><br>On 1 June 2022, Payne was interviewed by Logan Paul for his
                    podcast series, where he, while intoxicated, brought up several topics, among which he claimed that
                    One Direction originated with Simon Cowell's promise to him, and discussed about former fellow
                    member Zayn Malik's family life, where he declared, "There's many reasons why I dislike Zayn
                    and there's many reasons why I'll always, always be on his side." He then faced backlash
                    with the veracity of several of his claims contested. He subsequently clarified his remarks on
                    Malik and apologised. Later, in 2023, he announced his sobriety and revealed that he went
                    to a rehab facility after the controversial interview.<br><br>Liam Payne has been at the center of
                    several controversies over the past few years. From unearthed One Direction drama to that
                    embarrassing podcast appearance. Now, he's coming under fire with multiple accusations made by his
                    ex-fiance Maya Henry.</p>
