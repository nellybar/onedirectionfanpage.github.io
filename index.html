            <h2>Who were they?</h2>
            <p>
                British-Irish male vocal group whose stylish good looks and
                bright pop-rock sound captivated young fans around the world in
                the early 2010s.<br><br>The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a talent
                contest for aspiring singers. Each of the five members auditioned and originally competed as a solo
                performer, but early in the season they were advised to pool their talents. Taking the name One
                Direction, all the boys were between 16 and 18 years old at the time attracted substantial attention, especially from
                young female viewers, for their charismatic stage presence and vocal skills. Although One Direction
                ultimately fell short of winning on The X Factor, the show's mastermind, Simon Cowell, offered the act a
                recording contract soon after the season ended.<br><br>After releasing five best-selling albums between
                2011
                and 2015, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, beginning December 2015. By May 2017, all members had
                released solo material, and by January 2020 all band members had released solo albums.
