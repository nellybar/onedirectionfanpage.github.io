            <h3>Most Watched Music Video</h3>
            <p>It should come as no surprise that the most watched music video
                is for "What Makes You Beautiful," One Direction's all-time
                best-selling single. After placing third on The X Factor in
                2010, the song, which served as their debut single, rocketed to
                the top of the UK charts and remained there for four weeks. With
                4.8 million copies sold, it was certified quadruple Platinum in
                the US in June 2016.
                <br><br>It sold one million copies and received three platinum
                certifications in the UK. Over 1.4 billion people have seen the
                music video on YouTube to date.
